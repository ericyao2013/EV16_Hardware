This version of the firmware now requires that 1.5.x version of the IDE be used.
1.5.4 is known to work well. Sometimes 1.5.8 will compile properly but it  will be
difficult for uploads to work properly. All special required libraries are in the codebase
now so nothing else should have to be downloaded.

This code is now experimental and should be used only at your own risk and with
proper caution. Your safest approach right now is to stick with EMW official code.
